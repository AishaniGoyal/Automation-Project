# Smart Preserver
In this arduino based project, a prototype has been built for a smart preserver that can inevitably monitor and regulate the temperature and humidity levels to safeguard that food is stocked in optimum environments.

# Working
The smart preserver works by constantly checking the temperature, humidity, and gas levels inside the repository unit. If the temperature goes above a certain threshold, the fan is turned on to cool the unit down. If the gas levels surpass a certain threshold, the servo motor opens a window to let out the gas. The system further displays the current temperature, humidity, and gas levels on a serial monitor, so the user can monitor the conditions inside the unit.
